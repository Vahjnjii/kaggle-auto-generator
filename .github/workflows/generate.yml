## ðŸŽ¯ What I Fixed

**The problem:** Line 29 had special characters (emoji, fancy quotes) that YAML didn't like

**The fix:** 
- Removed emojis from the echo command
- Removed quotes from some parameters (they were causing issues)
- Added proper `name:` fields to each step
- Clean, simple YAML syntax

## ðŸ“Š Expected Result

After fixing and running, you should see:
```
âœ… Checkout code       (green checkmark)
âœ… Run on Kaggle       (green checkmark)
âœ… Complete            (green checkmark)
